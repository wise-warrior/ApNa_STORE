Its a Basically a simple e-commerce site , built using HTML , CSS and PHP 
( for backend scripting ) ( no database integration done ) . The Site offers
some items with their specifications and the user can add them to the cart 
and manage the cart for purchases . its a just a result of me exploring and
brushing up my Web Dev Skills :)
